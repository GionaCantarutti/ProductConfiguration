**The idea**

The idea is to make a storepage that lets you design your own rubik's cube in, at the very least, size, per-cube material and per-cube sticker colors (possibly with support for textures)

It also could implement a way to visualize how the rotations would look

**Progress**

*Day 1:* implemented a simple function that uses a few parameters (number of cubes per dimension, size of the cubes and spacing) to generate a basic rubik's cube

*Day 2:* added stickers to the cubes and a material brush that allows to change any clicked mesh into a set material

*Day 3:* updated sticker generation so that they do not end up flipped. Added proper UVs to the stickers to appy textures to them.
